# Store-Database
The designed program follows the requirements set forth by the project guidelines. The project is required to build a database of a simplified version of a hypothtical store database keeping customer and inventory information. The program would securely and efficently store information regarding various customers shopping and various computers. Each customer instance would hold information regarding their first and last name, their membership ID number, and their account cash availability. The computer object holds information regarding computer name, its technical specifications, and price. Then the program displays a menu of choices to the user and performs the chosen task. It will keep asking a user to enter the next choice until the choice of 'Q' (Quit) is entered. It will create an object of Store containing a list of computers and customers, and perform insertion, deletion, search, sorting, displaying, closing, serialization, deserialization, writing to a file, and reading from a file.

**Program not fully functional due to project at the time not implementing full error catching and input flexibility. Strict input format is required for program to work as specified by the project guidelines.**
